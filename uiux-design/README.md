# Butopea Product Page Redesign

## Overview
Redesign of Butopea's product pages to improve conversion rates and reduce customer support queries while maintaining user familiarity.

## Research Phase
I started by studying high-converting e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay to understand what makes product pages successful. This gave me insights into proven patterns that drive conversions.

## Problem Analysis
Looking at the current Butopea pages, I identified three key issues:
- Delivery information was buried, causing customer support headaches
- Visual hierarchy was cluttered, making it hard to focus on key actions
- The design felt outdated but couldn't be completely overhauled without confusing users

## Design Process
1. **Sketched wireframes** on paper to map out information hierarchy
2. **Used Figma make** to create rough layouts (though I'm still learning it)
3. **Translated Hungarian text** to understand content priorities
4. **Built final mockups** in Canva with clean visual structure

## Key Solutions
- **Prominent delivery badges** to reduce support queries and build confidence
- **Cleaner information flow** guiding users from product → trust signals → purchase
- **Mobile-optimized CTAs** for responsiveness
- **Fresh visual treatment** while maintaining familiar layout patterns

## Expected Impact
These changes should increase add-to-cart conversions and dramatically reduce delivery-related customer service inquiries, while giving the brand a modern feel without losing user familiarity.
